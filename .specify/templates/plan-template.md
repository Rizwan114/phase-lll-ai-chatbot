# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/sp.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: [e.g., Python 3.11, Swift 5.9, Rust 1.75 or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Primary Dependencies**: [e.g., FastAPI, UIKit, LLVM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Storage**: [if applicable, e.g., PostgreSQL, CoreData, files or N/A]  
**Testing**: [e.g., pytest, XCTest, cargo test or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Target Platform**: [e.g., Linux server, iOS 15+, WASM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Project Type**: [single/web/mobile - determines source structure]  
**Performance Goals**: [domain-specific, e.g., 1000 req/s, 10k lines/sec, 60 fps or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Constraints**: [domain-specific, e.g., <200ms p95, <100MB memory, offline-capable or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Scale/Scope**: [domain-specific, e.g., 10k users, 1M LOC, 50 screens or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### Spec-First Discipline Check
- [ ] All requirements trace back to approved spec
- [ ] Feature specification exists and is complete
- [ ] Implementation plan references specific spec sections
- [ ] MCP tools, API endpoints, and data models documented in spec

### Stateless Architecture Check
- [ ] FastAPI server designed as stateless
- [ ] All state persisted in PostgreSQL (Neon) only
- [ ] AI agents interact with tasks only through MCP tools
- [ ] No in-memory state or server-side session storage
- [ ] Conversation state reconstructed from database on every request

### Data Integrity and User Isolation Check
- [ ] User ownership enforced at MCP tool layer
- [ ] Cross-user data access impossible by design
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets in implementation plan
- [ ] Database schema supports multi-user isolation

### Tech Stack Compliance Check
- [ ] Uses only approved stack (FastAPI, SQLModel, Neon PostgreSQL, OpenAI Agents SDK, MCP)
- [ ] No unauthorized technology deviations
- [ ] Dependencies align with constitutional requirements

### MCP Tool Contract Check
- [ ] Only approved MCP tools used (add_task, list_tasks, complete_task, update_task, delete_task)
- [ ] Tools validate input and enforce user ownership
- [ ] Tools return structured, predictable output
- [ ] Error responses are explicit and machine-readable

### AI Agent Behavior Check
- [ ] Agent uses OpenAI Agents SDK
- [ ] Agent selects MCP tools based on user intent
- [ ] Multi-step reasoning planned where required
- [ ] Agent never hallucinated task IDs or fabricates outputs

### Agentic Workflow Check
- [ ] Plan assumes agent-generated code (no manual coding)
- [ ] Follows Read Spec → Plan → Tasks → Implement → Validate order
- [ ] Automated testing strategy included

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
