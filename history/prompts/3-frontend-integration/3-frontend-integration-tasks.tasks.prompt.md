## Response Text

Successfully generated comprehensive implementation tasks for the Frontend & Integration feature. The tasks.md file includes:

1. **Structured Phases**: Organized into Setup, Foundational, User Stories (P1-P3), and Polish phases
2. **User Story Mapping**: Tasks organized by priority (P1-P3) with corresponding story labels [US1], [US2], [US3]
3. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Tasks covering Next.js project setup, authentication infrastructure, API service layer, component architecture, and page structure
4. **Parallel Opportunities**: Identified tasks that can run in parallel with [P] markers
5. **Constitutional Compliance**: Added validation tasks to ensure adherence to security and quality requirements
6. **Test Tasks**: Included contract and integration tests as appropriate per user story
7. **File Paths**: Specific file paths for all implementation tasks
8. **Dependencies**: Clear dependency structure with blocking prerequisites

The task list enables incremental delivery starting with the MVP (User Story 1) and allows for parallel development across multiple team members. All tasks follow the required checklist format with proper IDs, story labels, and file paths.

## Outcome

Complete task breakdown ready for implementation with clear execution order and parallelization opportunities.

## Evaluation

The generated tasks successfully map to all requirements from the specification and plan, enabling systematic implementation of the Next.js frontend with proper authentication integration, API communication, and responsive UI design while maintaining security and user experience standards.
