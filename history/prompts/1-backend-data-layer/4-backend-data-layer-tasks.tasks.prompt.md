## Prompt Text

```

```

## Response Text

Generated comprehensive task list for the Core Backend & Data Layer implementation. Created 62 tasks organized across 8 phases: Setup, Foundational, and 5 User Stories (P1-P2 priorities) plus Polish phase. Tasks follow the required format with checkboxes, IDs, parallel markers [P], and story labels [US1-US5]. Included constitutional compliance validation tasks to ensure adherence to project principles. Each user story is designed to be independently implementable and testable.

## Outcome

Successfully created a detailed task breakdown with 62 specific tasks organized by user story priority and with proper dependencies.

## Evaluation

Tasks are well-structured, follow the required format, and align with both the specification and constitutional requirements. Ready for implementation phase.
